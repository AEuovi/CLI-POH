# Passport Office Helper (POH)
This is a small app created by a member of the Ukraine EMC comunity and a the head of Ukraine EMC passport office AEuovi.
The code is mostly hand written, with refactoring and optimization done by OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 model

## System requirements:
- As long as your system can run Java 8 (which I hope it does, otherwise god help your soul) you can run this

## Instalation:
### Windows:
  1. Download the 32 or 64 bit (depending on your OS) release of the app
  2. Unzip it
  3. Run the .exe file
### Mac/Linux:
  1. Download Java 8
  2. Install it
  3. Download the .jar release of the app
  4. Open Terminal
  5. Navigate to the apps location
  6. Type `java -jar packageName.jar` replacing "packageName.jar" with the name of the app

## Plans for the future:
- ~Better Text UI~
- Maybe GUI, but that's in the far future
- Globally shared passport list
- Automatic passport creation
- Automatic expiration notification
